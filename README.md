# Terra Translation Report Generator

Python automation script creating monthly/overall payment reports of Terra Translation

## How-to

Download the csv files from Terra Translation, and save them to a directory named `data/`.

**NOTE**: You might need to make a few changes in those csv files using **VS Code**. Make sure the project code (`E00XXX`) in each file consistent with the one listed on [Terra Translation MemoQ](https://terra.memoqworld.com/memoqweb/).

In the terminal, run:

```shell
./run.sh
```

The reports are in the directory `report`.
